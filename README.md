# Interactive Envelope

This project was my first ever as a computer science student. While it might seem like a simple stupid and perhaps cringeworthy idea , I just wanted to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is an interactive envelope that reveals a random animated gif and message when clicked.

## Project Overview

The Interactive Envelope is a playful web application where users click on an envelope to reveal a surprise message and gif. This project helped me understand the basics of web development, including styling with CSS and adding interactivity with JavaScript.

## Used

- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on the envelope to reveal the surprise message and gif.
